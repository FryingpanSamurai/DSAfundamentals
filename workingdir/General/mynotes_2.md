# CHAPTER 2
## SDLC
### 7 Stages to SDLC
- Requirements Specification: process to understand the problem and detail function of the program
- System Analysis: analyze data flow to id the systems I/O, helpful to determine output and then reverse engineer what input data is required
- System Design: obtaining output from the input; Input, Process, Output (IPO) breaking down the problem into manageable components and design strategies for implementation
- Implementation: translating the system design into code; separate programs are written for each component and then integrated; coding, self-testing, and debugging
- Testing: ensure program meets requirements specifications with minimal errors
- Deployment: launching the application to the end-user via production environment/web server/locally
- Maintenance: updating and improving the program
