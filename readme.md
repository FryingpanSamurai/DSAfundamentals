# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Mission
I plan to use this git to help me study and understand Data Structures and the Algorithms behind them.

## Vision
I will commit myself to daily study in the pursuit of mastering DS&A.

## Goal
To further my professional knowledge and establish more confidence in my coding ability.
I also would like to be proficient in high-level languages as well as mid-level languages.
I have a special place in my heart for C, but I don't personally work with assembly or C, so... that's for another time I suppose.
